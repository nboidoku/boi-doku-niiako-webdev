My name is Nii Ako Boi-Doku and I am a second-year student at Northeastern
University seeking a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
I currently spend most of my time working on projects in Satellite Labs,
which is a Ghanaian tech startup building products to propel development in
Ghana.


This repository is meant for the Web Development Spring 2017 class.
